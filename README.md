# Amenthyx AI Teams v3.0

**59 specialized virtual engineering teams** powered by Claude Code's subagent orchestration.

Each team is a complete, self-contained execution protocol — with specialized roles, domain-specific quality gates, wave-based parallel execution, automated PM reporting (PPTX + PDF), **evidence-driven execution**, **atomic commits**, **comprehensive testing**, and **real-time GitHub kanban tracking**.

## What's New in v3.0

- **Evidence & Proof Protocol** — every agent produces verifiable proof: screenshots, build logs, test results, runtime health checks
- **Local Install & Test** — agents install, build, and test locally as if deploying to production
- **Atomic Commits** — every single change is a separate git commit with conventional format and issue references
- **Comprehensive Testing** — full test pyramid: static analysis, unit, integration, E2E, performance, security, release
- **GitHub Actions Local Testing** — CI/CD workflows validated locally with `act` before pushing
- **Real-Time Kanban** — PM maintains GitHub Projects V2 board with real-time card movement and evidence-linked issues
- **30 New Teams** — expanded from 21 to 51 specialized teams covering every major engineering domain
- **8 Multimedia & Creative Teams** — expanded from 51 to 59 teams with motion graphics, video, 3D, audio, animation, generative AI, streaming, and media pipeline teams

## Quick Start

```
--team <teamName> --strategy path/to/strategy.md
```

1. Copy `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md` and fill it out with your project brief
2. Activate a team with the `--team` command
3. The team self-organizes: plans, builds, tests, and ships — with evidence at every step

## How It Works

### Activation Protocol

When you say `--team <name> --strategy <path>`:

1. The activation protocol matches `<name>` to a team folder
2. The strategy file is loaded as project context
3. The Enhanced Execution Protocol is loaded (evidence, testing, commits)
4. The Team Leader agent boots and reads the team's `TEAM.md`
5. Agents spawn in waves — planning first, then engineering in parallel, then QA, then release
6. PM creates a GitHub Project board, milestones, and issues via `gh` CLI
7. Every agent produces evidence (screenshots, logs, test results)
8. Every change is an atomic commit with conventional format
9. GitHub Actions are tested locally with `act` before pushing
10. PPTX status reports and PDF summaries are generated every 6 hours

### Strategy File

Every team activation requires a strategy file. Copy `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md` (v3.0) and fill it out. The enhanced strategy template includes:

- Project identity, audience, and features (prioritized P0/P1/P2)
- Technical constraints with specific technology choices
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- **Testing requirements** (coverage targets, required test types, CI/CD config)
- Timeline with milestones and success criteria
- **Evidence requirements** (what proof you need from the team)
- Risk analysis and hard/soft constraints

### Team Structure

Every team follows the same organizational pattern:

```
         USER
           |
      TEAM LEADER (orchestrator)
           |
     +-----+-----+
     |     |     |
    PM   MKT  LEGAL
     |
  +--+--+--+--+
  |  |  |  |  |
 [5-7 domain-specific engineers]
     |
    QA
     |
  RELEASE MGR
```

### Wave Execution (v3.0 Enhanced)

```
Wave 0: Initialization
  ├── TL boots, reads strategy + enhanced protocol
  ├── Create .team/ directory with evidence/ structure
  └── Verify tools: gh, act, language runtime

Wave 1: Planning (PM foreground)
  ├── Project charter, milestones, kanban, risk register
  ├── GitHub Project board + milestones + issues (with evidence requirements)
  ├── Create COMMIT_LOG.md template
  └── Initial PPTX + PDF

  └── Deployment sign-off

Wave 5: Final Reporting
  ├── Final PPTX with complete evidence dashboard
  ├── Final PDF with commit log + test coverage
  ├── Close all GitHub milestones
  └── TL presents summary to user
```

### Evidence & Proof (v3.0)

Every agent produces verifiable evidence:

```
.team/evidence/
├── manifests/          # Evidence manifests per agent
├── builds/             # Build artifacts and logs
├── tests/              # Test results by layer
│   ├── static/         # Lint, type-check, security scan
│   ├── unit/           # Unit test results + coverage
│   ├── integration/    # Integration test results
│   ├── e2e/            # E2E test results + screenshots
│   ├── performance/    # Load test reports
│   ├── security/       # Vulnerability scan reports
│   └── release/        # Smoke test results
├── screenshots/        # Visual proof
├── runtime/            # Health checks, running app proof
├── deps/               # Dependency trees, audit reports
├── diffs/              # Before/after diffs
└── ci/                 # GitHub Actions local test results (act)
```

### PM GitHub Integration (v3.0)

The PM agent uses `gh` CLI with real-time tracking:

- Creates GitHub Projects V2 board with custom fields (Wave, Agent, Evidence, Commit)
- Creates issues with **evidence requirements** in the body
- Moves cards in real-time as agents start/complete/block
- Links commit hashes and evidence artifacts to issues
- Adds evidence:verified/missing labels
- Creates GitHub Releases with test results and evidence summaries

See `shared/PM_GITHUB_INTEGRATION.md` for full details.

### Reporting (v3.0)

- **PPTX**: Dark-themed, 11 slides including evidence dashboard, test coverage, commit activity, CI status
- **PDF**: Activity summaries with evidence summary, commit log, test coverage metrics
- Scripts in `shared/PPTX_GENERATOR.py` and `shared/PDF_GENERATOR.py`

## Adding New Teams

1. Create a new numbered folder: `52-your-team/`
2. Add a `TEAM.md` following the v3.0 structure (including evidence, testing, commits sections)
3. Set the `Activation` keyword in the header
4. Push to this repo — the team becomes immediately available

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** CLI with Task tool (subagent orchestration)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) authenticated for PM GitHub integration
- **act** ([nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act)) for local GitHub Actions testing
- **Python 3.8+** with `python-pptx` and `reportlab` for reporting
- **Domain-specific tools** per team (language runtimes, build tools, etc.)

```bash
# Install reporting dependencies
pip install python-pptx reportlab

# Install act for local CI testing
# macOS: brew install act
# Windows: scoop install act / choco install act-cli
# Linux: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```
